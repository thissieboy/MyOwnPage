      <h3 id="Stumble" >Stumble</h3>
      <pre id="italic">
A glimmer of the sun
through clouds that won
the battle with the light
still there is a ray of sunlight
defying the clouds and the rain
enforcing the crowds and the pain

No fault at play
pointing fingers which have none to say
Blame which we give out
return none which we care about

Actions left unspoken
where the past is broken
no part to play
after all we had to say

Memories that bring up a life
so perfect without strife
no reason to not get what she sought
or that was what we thought

The call that made us come together
on a day with much better weather
woke us up from a dream
where perfect was the mean

Did it have to be such a tragedy
before we could see reality
Sadly this is where we crumble
Was it a step or a stumble
while standing here together in the rain
We all feel the impact of that train

<h3 id="Slow Future">Slow Future</h3>
<pre id="italic">
Beneath the stars that are slowly fading
there is a shimmer of light within the distance
a beauty described as more than breaking
the bright will follow without assistance

a beauty outside, a house to feel at home
a shimmer of light, a tree that has now grown
a past to reach out to and leave at peace
a future to look to while we reach

reach out to a life never lived
without honor, beauty or a simple twist
to break up the fight
in the never ending night

but when the morning breaks
the light never fades
we stand all together
outside in this beautiful weather

now do not fade away at night
while were looking for the right
to help you out from under this stone
while were looking where it's shown

And now when the end is in sight
we leave this beach without a fight
the sand will never touch us again
until a time we will never know when

<h3 id="A cruel world" >A cruel world</h3>
<pre id="italic">
How unfair the world turns
One can get what he not earns
Nothing is final
Except ones survival
In this unjust world
To become strong and wise
In the storms of men
And rise above the skies
To be free again
